# ToDoListApplication
•	This To-Do List application is a Java console-based project that allows users to add, view, complete, and delete tasks. It uses OOP principles with a Task class to store task details and a To-Do List class to manage tasks.  
•	The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can input choices using a Scanner. Each task has a unique ID, description, and completion status  
•	Users can mark tasks as completed, and completed tasks are displayed accordingly. The application uses an ArrayList to store tasks dynamically. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
